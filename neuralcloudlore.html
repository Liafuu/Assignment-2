    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img src="images/intronc.jpg" style="width:80%">  
    <p>Girls’ Frontline: Neural Cloud is a spinoff of Girls’ Frontline, taking place three years after “Project Neural Cloud'' in 2060. The project was a 2-month collaboration between the International Institute of Quantum Sciences and the Important Operations Prototype Corporation (IOP). Led by the 42LAB organization, with assistance from renowned AI and Doll researcher, Persicaria, in the form of a Doll made to be her exact copy. The player takes the role of the “Professor”, the lead researcher of Project Neural Cloud.</p>
    <p>During the project, willing owners across the world donated their Dolls to the program. Using 42LAB’s “Magrasea Super Cloud Server”, the goal of the test was the creation of the Neural Cloud system for second-generation Dolls through the fusion of various quantum computing and AI technologies. The hope was that the system would grant Dolls further security and protection of their memory data. This system would help minimize the loss of data in the event the Neural Cloud was damaged. The story begins on September 23rd, 2063, when Persica and a G&K Commander investigate what happened three years ago during the project. Uploading their mind into Magrasea, the Commander assumes the role of the “Professor”, seeking the truth about what happened three years ago and the original 42LAB Professor who disappeared.</p>

    <h2>What are Neursouls?</h2>
    <img src="images/neuralsoul.jpg" style="width:80%">
    <p>A “Neursoul” is a new term introduced in Neural Cloud, but its purpose is already well-understood. Neursouls are equivalent to a Doll’s Digimind in Girls’ Frontline, and they function and are structured similarly to Digiminds. A Neursoul core is a module where all data relating to a Doll’s personality, core orders, and current memories are stored. The modular data within the core is the “Neursoul”. Dolls’ Neursouls are structured into three levels: Level I, II, and III, where the core operational data is stored.
      <br>The data of a Neursoul can be backed up, but in the event of a reset, memories and experiences are not preserved. In Magrasea, Neursoul data is used as a projection of a Doll’s appearance in the server. Their Neursoul Projection can replicate real-world clothing, personal items, pets, and other things.</p>

      <h2>Magrasea Super Cloud Server & Its Sectors</h2>
      <img src="images/corp.webp" style="width:80%">
      <p>Beginning in 2053 and completed in 2057, the Magrasea Super Cloud Server is a massive cloud server created and run by the 42LAB Institute, a subordinate to the International Institute of Quantum Sciences (IIQS). Used for cloud services for governments, major corporations, institutes, and even private owners, Magrasea is home to many projects and data for these groups. This can range from simple, privately-owned, digital art collections to top secret military-industrial projects. Each user of its services is provided an independent sector within the cloud, where Processes are banned from entering other sectors or causing damage to their own. </p>

      <h2>Project Sanctifier</h2>
      <img src="images/sanct.png" style="width:80%">
      <p>During the construction of the Magrasea server, 42LAB staff recognized the exceptional importance of cybersecurity and the protection of the server from attacks, viruses, and even complex AI viruses. AI viruses are viruses designed by AIs, and they pose the greatest threat to the server because of their extraordinary growth and development that has the potential to break through traditional antivirus firewalls. To counter this threat, 42LAB began development on “Project Sanctifier” in 2055. With support from IIQS, 42LAB went to work designing an ingenious solution to the challenges faced. Their solution was the Sanctifiers - an AI antivirus program that would combat all abnormal Processes present in the cloud server. Like AI viruses, Sanctifier had self-learning and growth abilities. Further, even in absence of human observation and viruses, the program would maintain constant security over its respective system.</p>

    <h2>The Professor</h2>
<img src="images/prof.jpg" style="width:80%">
<p>In 2062, a message made its way to Professor Persica (the real human) about Project Neural Cloud that had taken place two years prior. Something had happened that 42LAB covered up and lied about, leading to Persica beginning an investigation into the events of Project Neural Cloud. On September 23rd, 2063, a Griffin Commander, began the investigation with Persica into the Magrasea server to discover the truth behind the project and the fate of the original Professor (and supervisor) of PNC. Using an off-site backup and experimental mind-upload technology, the Commander’s mind was uploaded to the server, becoming the second human to ever enter. Upon awakening in Magrasea, the Commander assumed the role of the Professor. As the main character, the Professor is tasked with finding the truth behind Project Neural Cloud, discovering the fate of the original Professor, and saving all the Dolls who remain trapped in the server.</p>
