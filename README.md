## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Subscription form:
    1. Go to the "Home" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
-	With the help of media query and flexboxes, the website resizes itself accordingly to ensure all the contents will be intact.

The size of texts, images and embedded videos are adjusted accordingly.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

No interesting bugs as of now.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
